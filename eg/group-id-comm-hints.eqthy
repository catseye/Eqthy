axiom (id-right) mul(A, e) = A
axiom (id-left)  mul(e, A) = A
axiom (assoc)    mul(A, mul(B, C)) = mul(mul(A, B), C)

theorem (id-comm)
    mul(A, e) = mul(e, A)
proof
    A = A                   [by reflexivity]
    mul(A, e) = A           [by id-right on LHS]
    mul(A, e) = mul(e, A)   [by id-left on RHS]
