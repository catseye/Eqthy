**Eqthy** is a formalized language for equational proofs.  Its design attempts to
reconcile _simplicity of implementation on a machine_ with _human usability_
([more on this below](#design-principles)).  It supports an elementary linear
style, where each line gives a step which is derived from the step on the previous
line, and may optionally state the justification for the derivation in that step.
Here is an example:

    axiom (idright) mul(A, e) = A
    axiom (idleft)  mul(e, A) = A
    axiom (assoc)   mul(A, mul(B, C)) = mul(mul(A, B), C)
    theorem (idcomm)
        mul(A, e) = mul(e, A)
    proof
        A = A
        mul(A, e) = A           [by idright]
        mul(A, e) = mul(e, A)   [by idleft]
    qed

For improved human usability, Eqthy is usually embedded within Markdown documents.
This allows proofs to be written in a more "literate" style, with interspersed
explanatory prose and references in the form of hyperlinks.

For a fuller description of the language, including a set of Falderal
tests, see **[doc/Eqthy.md](doc/Eqthy.md)**.

A number of proofs have been written in Eqthy to date.  These can be found in
the **[eg/](eg/)** directory.  In particular, there are worked-out proofs:

*   of the [Socks and Shoes](eg/socks-and-shoes.eqthy.md) theorem in group theory
*   in [Propositional Algebra](eg/propositional-algebra.eqthy.md)

with hopefully more to come in the future.

The Eqthy language is still at an early stage and is subject to change.  However,
since the idea is to accumulate a database of proofs which can be built upon,
it is unlikely that the format of the language will change radically.

### Design Principles

Probably the language that Eqthy most resembles, in spirit, is
[Metamath][]; but its underlying mechanics are rather different.
Eqthy is based on [equational logic][], so each step is an equation.

Eqthy's design attempts to reconcile simplicity of implementation on a machine
with human usability.  It should be understood that this is a balancing act;
adding features to the language which improve usability will generally be
detrimental to simplicity, and vice versa.

It has been implemented in Python in about 550 lines of code; the core
verifier module is less than 200 lines of code.  For more details, see
the [Implementations](#implementations) section below.

It is also possible for a human to write Eqthy documents by hand, and
to read them, without much specialized knowledge.  The base logic
is [equational logic][], which has only 5 rules of inference, and these
rules are particularly widely understood; "replace equals with equals" is
a standard part of the high-school algebra cirriculum.

(In comparison, `mmverifier.py`, a Python implementation of a Metamath
checker, is 360 lines of code; and while it is undoubtedly simple, the
Metamath language is not widely regarded as being easy to write or read.)

### Implementations

While the language does not prescribe any specific application for proofs
written in Eqthy, it is reasonable to expect that one of the main reasons
one would want a computer to read one would be for it to check it for validity.

This distribution contains such a proof checker, written in Python 3.
The source code for it can be found in the **[src/](src/)** directory.

The core module that does proof checking,
**[eqthy.verifier](src/eqthy/verifier.py)**, is less than 200 lines in length,
despite having many logging statements (which both act as comments, and provide a
trace to help the user understand the execution of the verifier on any given
document).

The desire is to make reading the code and understanding its behaviour as
un-intimidating as possible.

TODO
----

*   Handle "on LHS", "on RHS" in hints.
*   Allow context accumulated when verifying one document to be
    carried over and used when verifying the next documnet.
*   Allow the first line of a proof to be an axiom.
*   Arity checking?  Would prevent some silly errors in axioms.
